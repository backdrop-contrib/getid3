getID3t
======================
The getID3() module facilitates the installation and management of the [getID3() PHP library](https://www.getid3.org), used to extract useful information from MP3s and other multimedia file formats.

This API module is used by other modules to ensure that getID3() is correctly installed. Developers who need the getID3() functionality can make this a dependency by their module, and use the getID3() library.
